Or, do we too often move to\na new area without knowing exactly what we're getting into, forcing us to turn tail and run atthe first sign of discomfort?\nTo minimize the chances of this happening, we should always do proper research when planning our next move in life. Consider the following factors when picking a new place to live so you don't end up wasting your valuable time and money making a move you'll end up regretting. Safety is a top concern when moving to a new area.
